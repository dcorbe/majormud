//! Autonomous farming: the `[farm]` configuration and the validated

//! A patrol circuit is a list of rooms the character walks between,
//! farming each with the [`crate::bot`] policy core. Every room id and
//! every leg between them is checked against the room graph up front —
//! a typo in `[farm].circuit` must fail before the client connects, not
//! halfway around the lap with a live character standing in a spawn.
